# ZPRE-10 Physical Build Sketch – Modular Rig

This rig layout is intended for prototyping the physical implementation of ZPRE-10's General Field Energy Engine using **layered acoustic cavities**, **LIG substrate**, and **field harmonics control**.

## Components:

- **Primary Housing**: Cylindrical, layered wave cavity with adjustable resonance plates.
- **UDP Core Module**: Centrally mounted dampener node surrounded by FxLMS coils.
- **Power Matrix**: Dual-channel system for passive and active intercept operations.
- **Shield Array**: Optional field suppression mesh embedded within frame.

## Notes:

- Build uses **OpenSCAD-compatible layout**.
- LIG layers are preferred for high-yield but can be substituted with graphene foams.
- Mock CAD under development — export ready by ZPRE-12 phase.
