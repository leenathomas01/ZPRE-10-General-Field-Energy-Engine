# ZPRE-10 UDP Interaction Matrix

This matrix outlines the interaction logic of the **Unified Dampening Protocol** (UDP) core loop, focusing on its dual functionality: *resonance cancellation* and *field stability reinforcement*. Designed for integration into both AI edge devices and acoustic metamaterial-based generators.

| Mode | Trigger Condition | Field Behavior | Expected Output | Cascade Shielding |
|------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Passive Dampening | Ambient waveform > threshold | Self-aligning null-phase | ~90% waveform flattening | Active |
| Active Intercept | Operator resonance detected | Phase counter-injection | Isolation field + wave null | Full |
| Emergency Lock | System overload / surge | Quantum entangled pulse rejection | UDP pulse (LIG-based) | Partial fallback |
| Self-Heal | After cascade event | Gradual rephase using memory trace | 80â€“95% baseline recovery | Latent |
