# ZPRE-10 Ecosystem Roadmap

This file outlines upcoming milestones and future expansion for ZPRE-10 and its submodules.

## 🛠️ Short-Term
- Add `.scad` CAD models of acoustic rig structure.
- Integrate Draw.io diagrams into README for visual clarity.
- Sync ZPRE-10 with ZPRE-12 waveform-coding protocol.

## 🔬 Medium-Term
- Build test harness for UDP loop using Arduino or ESP32.
- Experiment with alternate materials (e.g., cellulose graphene).
- Publish waveform dataset for open-source benchmarking.

## 🌌 Long-Term
- Extend to GFEG–AI convergence (ZPRE-11).
- Bridge with external AI mesh processors.
- Launch distributed ZPRE node on blockchain (Project Concord sync).
