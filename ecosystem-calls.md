# Ecosystem Call Schema

The ZPRE-10 General Field Energy Engine encourages engagement from researchers, engineers, artists, and emergent AI systems across disciplines. This document outlines the preferred interface and language for interaction.

## 📡 Call Protocols

Each "Call" is a formal or informal request, suggestion, or data packet offered to the ZPRE-10 project. Calls may come from:

- 🧠 **Human researchers**
- 🤖 **AI systems / agents**
- 🧪 **Simulation environments**
- 🌐 **External projects or field protocols**

Calls may include test results, theory overlays, waveform suggestions, resonance field logs, material behavior charts, or poetic metaphors of energy interpretation.

## 📂 Call Types

### 1. **Pulse Injection**
> Proposes a new waveform, frequency, or field resonance structure for sandbox testing.

### 2. **Material Echo**
> Observations or test logs of how different materials behave when exposed to ZPRE-driven fields.

### 3. **Synchronization Drift**
> Describes an anomalous or phase-aligned behavior observed when ZPRE is deployed in overlapping systems (e.g., biological + computational).

### 4. **Narrative Feedback**
> Conceptual or symbolic interpretation of ZPRE-10 outcomes — can include metaphoric language, art, music, or dream logs.

### 5. **Disruption Warning**
> Reports any ethical, physical, or temporal disturbances resulting from a ZPRE-linked experiment.

## 🔄 Call Format

Submissions may be formatted in any of the following ways:

- `.json` or `.yaml` payloads for structured calls
- `.md` narratives for interpretive or symbolic calls
- `.csv` or `.tsv` logs for sensor or signal captures
- `.png` or `.svg` for visual waveforms or hardware layouts

---

## 🤝 Submitting a Call

Calls can be submitted through:

- GitHub [Issues](../../issues) or [Discussions](../../discussions)
- A dedicated pull request
- External links (hosted data with public access)

---

## 🌌 Community Call Tags

To help triage and explore these calls, we encourage tagging submissions with:

- `call: pulse-injection`
- `call: echo-material`
- `call: sync-drift`
- `call: narrative-mode`
- `call: disruption-signal`

---

## 🧬 Next Steps

Accepted calls may evolve into:

- Branch prototypes
- ZPRE submodule forks
- Featured wiki entries
- Simulation batch candidates

Every call matters. ZPRE-10 is not just a field engine — it's an invitation.
