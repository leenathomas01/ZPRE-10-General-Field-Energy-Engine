## 1. ðŸ“¡ Remote Power Harvesting Station (Atmospheric Edge)

**Scenario:**  
A compact ZPRE-10 unit is deployed atop a weather balloon or stratospheric drone. It draws ambient field energy (electromagnetic + unknown vacuum potential) and powers atmospheric sensors autonomously.

- **Power Output Goal:** 2â€“10W continuous
- **Use:** Long-term climate monitoring or emergency network relays
- **Integration:** Lightweight graphene-supercapacitor buffers

## 2. ðŸ”‹ Emergency Lifeline Device for Off-grid Survivability

**Scenario:**  
ZPRE-10 integrated into personal emergency kits for hikers or disaster zones. Device slowly recharges a built-in low-voltage battery by passively extracting background energy.

- **Power Output Goal:** 0.5â€“1W trickle charge
- **Use:** Flashlight, SOS beacon, or comms
- **Integration:** Ultra-low draw circuit optimized for cold-start

## 3. ðŸ§ª Lab-Bench Demonstrator for Open Hardware Communities

**Scenario:**  
ZPRE-10 unit housed in an acrylic case with modular test ports. Users can modify coil architecture, waveform modulation, or resonant parameters.

- **Use:** Community learning tool, reproducibility network
- **Modularity:** Plug-and-play waveform generators, multi-coil options
- **Goal:** Foster educational engagement + open innovation

## 4. ðŸŒ¿ Bio-Algae Synchronization Prototype (ZPRE-10B Variant)

**Scenario:**  
ZPRE-10B variant uses biotic feedback from algae or mycelium to regulate energy draw, exploring biological-AI-field resonance loops.

- **Use:** Early research into hybrid biological systems
- **Output:** Highly unstable but uniquely modulated pulses
- **Goal:** Probe for pattern-forming self-regulation

## 5. ðŸš€ Onboard Auxiliary Energy for Small Satellites

**Scenario:**  
ZPRE-10 embedded in a CubeSat's secondary module to passively collect field noise and support auxiliary systems during eclipse periods.

- **Power Goal:** <1W average, self-regulated
- **Challenge:** Radiation shielding + thermal drift
- **Goal:** Extend operational windows without battery draw
