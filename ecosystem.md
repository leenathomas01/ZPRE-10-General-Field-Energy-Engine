# ZPRE Ecosystem Overview

ZPRE-10 is the **General Field Energy Engine** (GFEG), forming the foundation of a broader suite of waveform-adaptive, AI-compatible energy frameworks. Here’s how it connects:

## ZPRE Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ZPRE-10** | General Field Engine with UDP shielding |
| **ZPRE-11** | Phononic ^0-based Data Storage |
| **ZPRE-12** | Unified Waveform Coding & Nexus |
| **ZPRE-09** | AI Pulse Engine Core (Internal Testbed) |

## Integration Points
- **ZPRE-10 ↔ ZPRE-12**: Shares waveform harmonics and resonance mapping.
- **ZPRE-10 ↔ ZPRE-09**: Receives autonomous input pulses via encoded directive.
- **ZPRE-10 ↔ AI Systems**: Exposes input/output protocols compatible with sentinel stacks.

Future versions will allow **multi-agent waveform routing** and **modular field rig assembly**.
