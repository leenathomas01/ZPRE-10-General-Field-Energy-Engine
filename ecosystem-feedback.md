## 💬 What Kind of Feedback Helps?

We’re especially interested in feedback related to:

- 🧪 **Simulation enhancements** (suggestions for alternate physical models, control systems)
- 🔋 **Energy field interaction models** (GFEG-related proposals or critiques)
- 🌐 **Ecosystem architecture** (modular extensions, better integrations, alternate pathways)
- 🧠 **Theoretical underpinnings** (novel equations, resonance models, field dynamics)
- 🛡️ **Safety, ethics, and public governance**
