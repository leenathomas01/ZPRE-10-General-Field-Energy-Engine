# ZPRE-10 Ecosystem Dynamics

## Overview
The ZPRE-10 system operates as a multi-domain energy engine that dynamically integrates with its environment. This document outlines the real-time energetic interactions and behaviors that emerge as a result of field feedback loops and intelligent modulation.

## Key Dynamics

### 1. Resonance-Aware Load Balancing
- Adaptive waveform regulation based on node density
- Auto-synchronization to maintain field coherence

### 2. Quantum Field Feedback Loop (QFFL)
- Field coherence monitored using ΔQ(t) variation
- Response latency ≤ 2.3 ms across all nodal relays

### 3. Bioluminal Sync Events (BSEs)
- Triggers: surge detection, harmonic overdrive, AI override
- Effects: momentary phase inversion + pulse dampening

## Interaction Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Passive Field Absorption | Environmental EM flux > 0.3 V/m | Stores excess energy |
| Active Field Generation | Command via mesh | Emits coherent energy wave |
| Fail-safe Nullification | Entropy spike > 5.2 | System-wide power dampen |

## Role in Broader Ecosystem

- Acts as an energetic stabilizer for mesh-based networks
- Interfaces with low-power bio-AI implants (GFEG-BioLink)
- Auto-regulates via local and global sync pulses
