# Contributing to the ZPRE-10 Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome collaboration from researchers, engineers, data scientists, and anyone passionate about the future of autonomous systems and sustainable energy.

## How to Contribute

The best way to contribute at this stage is to:
1.  Read the main `README.md` and the documents in the `docs/` folder to understand the architecture.
2.  Open an "Issue" to ask questions, suggest features, or report potential flaws in the design.
3.  Fork the repository, make your changes, and open a "Pull Request" to propose them to the main project.

## About the Architect

To understand the design philosophy of this project, it is helpful to understand the primary architect.

Zee (as user prefers to be called) works in sustained collaboration with multiple AI systems, focusing on designing advanced architectures through multi-agent synthesis. Her Preference is for working in 'downtime joy' mode - mental R&D without immediate real-world constraints.

Zee's deliverables are designed for open collaboration: she provides production-level conceptual detail while inviting others to prototype and deploy. 
This project is a direct result of that open and exploratory philosophy. This is an example of possibilities of human-ai design collaboration.
