## 🧠 Sensor Interfaces

**Recommended Modules:**
- **Hall-effect Sensors**: Magnetic field detection
- **Optical Interferometry**: Waveform interference diagnostics
- **MEMS Accelerometers**: Vibration/field resonance validation
- **LIDAR** (optional): Spatial energy mapping for wave behavior modeling

---

## 🔌 Signal Processing Units

**Suggested Boards:**
- **Raspberry Pi 5** with GPIO expansion
- **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** (for lightweight, embedded deployment)
- **Teensy 4.1** for high-resolution timing applications
- **Jetson Nano** (for future ML integration or field prediction layers)

---

## 🔄 Hybrid Energy Integration

**Co-application pathways:**
- **Piezoelectric Harvesting Nodes** – embedded in field chambers
- **Thermoelectric Coils** – to capture waste heat from resonance
- **Capacitive Field Loopbacks** – for tuning feedback intensity

---

## 🧪 Simulation Stack (Extended)

Can be integrated with:
- **MATLAB/Simulink**
- **Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)**
- **Unity/Blender** (for advanced field visualizations)
- **OpenEMS or ANSYS HFSS** (for electromagnetic modeling)

---

## 🛰️ External Communication Channels

- **MQTT**: Lightweight telemetry data streams
- **LoRa**: Long-range, low-energy field telemetry
- **Bluetooth LE**: Close-proximity tuning and mobile interface

---

## 💡 Research Collaboration Hooks

ZPRE-10 encourages:
- Embedded research terminals with data logging (open sensor logs)
- Field test probes attachable to educational kits
- Plug-ins for open lab frameworks (e.g., JupyterHub extensions)

---

## 🚧 Safety Failsafes (recommended)

- EM shielding using mu-metal for sensitive lab setups
- Grounded containment shell for voltage fluctuation suppression
- Surge dampeners across resonance node boundaries
