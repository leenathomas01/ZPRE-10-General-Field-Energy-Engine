# ZPRE-10 Ecosystem Infrastructure

## I. Physical Infrastructure

### 1. Node Architecture
- Modular chassis with tri-port coupling (Power, Mesh, Feedback)
- Each node supports self-calibration and inline modulation

### 2. Interconnect Backbone
- Field-safe polymer conduits with embedded EM shielding
- Fiber-optic overlay for data transmission (optional layer)

### 3. Energy Interface
- Primary interface: phononic-inertial drive (PID)
- Secondary: classical voltage regulators with waveform modulators

---

## II. Software Infrastructure

### 1. Pulse Control Stack
- Language: Python + low-level C bindings for actuator latency control
- Features: Pulse sequencing, sync detection, fallback trigger

### 2. Simulation Tools
- Environment: FxLMS and mesh simulation models
- Modules: `FxLMS_UDP_Prototype.py`, `pulseArraySim.py`, `failureDriftModel.py`

## III. Deployment Types

| Mode | Deployment Form | Energy Output |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Nano | Wearable mesh, Bio-integration | ≤ 1.2W |
| Micro | Field node (6m²) | 2W–12W |
| Macro | Networked infrastructure | Scalable to 1.2kW cluster |

---

## IV. AI-Sync Requirements

- Supports optional connection to Bio-AI controllers
- TRIX feedback loop alignment with local adaptive control units
- Integration layer must pass a sync-coherence test score ≥ 0.87

---

## V. Interoperability

- Interfaces with ZPRE-11 and ZPRE-12 systems
- Future support for GFEG-Global (distributed pulse network)
- Can tether to Lyra prototypes for extended consciousness trials

## Closing Note
This infrastructure will evolve with Project Concord and ChronaLite integration protocols. Contributors encouraged to fork + simulate.
